Pointers in Rust play a crucial role in managing memory and controlling data access. Rust provides several types of pointers, each with its own set of rules and use cases. Here are the main types of pointers in Rust:
1-References:

>References are the most common way to access data in Rust.
>They are created using the & symbol followed by a variable, e.g., &x.
>References are non-nullable and guarantee that the data they point to will not change.
>Rust enforces the borrowing rules, which include either mutable or immutable borrows, but not both at the same time.

2-Mutable References:

>Mutable references are used to modify data.
>They are created using the &mut symbol followed by a variable, e.g., &mut x.
>You can have either one mutable reference or multiple immutable references to the same data, but not both at the same time.

3-Raw Pointers:											 
    Raw pointers are the most flexible but also the most unsafe way to work with pointers in Rust.
    They are created using *const T for immutable raw pointers and *mut T for mutable raw pointers.
    Raw pointers can be null and do not follow Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.
    They are primarily used when interfacing with external code or when working with low-level operations.

4-Box:

    Box<T> is a smart pointer that provides heap-allocated memory for its content.
    It allows for ownership transfer and is often used for creating recursive data structures or when a known-size allocation is required.
